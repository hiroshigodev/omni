# Installing OMNI 🌌

OMNI is designed to be installed locally and integrated into your MCP environment.

## 🚀 One-Line Installation (Universal)

If you have **Zig 0.15.2** and **Node.js 18+** installed, you can set up OMNI in one step:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajarhide/omni/main/install.sh | sh
```

## 🍺 Homebrew (Beta)

If you use macOS or Linux with Homebrew, you can install OMNI via a custom tap:

1. **Tap the repository**:
   ```bash
   brew tap fajarhide/omni
   ```

2. **Install**:
   ```bash
   brew install omni
   ```

*(Note: Official Homebrew support is currently in setup phase via `omni.rb`).*

## 🛠 Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fajarhide/omni.git
   cd omni
   ```

2. **Run the Deployment Script**:
   This script builds the native core, Wasm core, and the MCP gateway.
   ```bash
   ./scripts/omni-deploy-edge.sh
   ```

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/omni-report.sh
   ```

## 🔌 Integration with AI Agents

OMNI is compatible with any tool that supports the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

### Claude Code / Antigravity
Add to `~/.claude/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omni": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/omni/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code Agents
1. Go to **Settings** or **MCP Configuration**.
2. Add a new server with the following details:
   - **Name**: `omni`
   - **Type**: `stdio` or `command`
   - **Command**: `node`
   - **Arguments**: `["/path/to/omni/dist/index.js"]`

### Generic MCP Agents
For any other agent, ensure the `node` environment is available and point the transport to OMNI's entry point: `/path/to/omni/dist/index.js`.

## 📦 Dependencies

- **Zig 0.15.2+**: Required for the high-performance core.
- **Node.js 18+**: Required for the MCP gateway.
- **Git**: Required for the installer script.
